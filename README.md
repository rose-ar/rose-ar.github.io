# CausalCity: Complex Simulations with Agency for Causal Discovery and Reasoning

This is the official code repository to accompany the paper "CausalCity: Complex Simulations with Agency for Causal Discovery and Reasoning".
Here we provide python code for generating and logging scenarios using the simulation environment as well as links to the baseline code used for running our experiments.
